# TTA-Keras

Test-Time Augmentation is a very efficient way to improve the results of your model at **testing** time.


### Here is how it works for a single image

After having trained our network, we can show it a test image and see it prediction.


Here is the query image :

![Optional Text](../master/Images/test_image.png)


Its prediction is :

![Optional Text](../master/Images/test_pred.png) 


While the true label is : 

![Optional Text](../master/Images/test_label.png)

So the test image is misclassified.


### But what happens if we apply TTA to that image ? 

Meaning that we will show the model several slightly modified versions of the image and average its predictions.

The 5 modified images are : 

![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_images.png)


And the corresponding predictions : 

- Prediction 1: ![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_pred1.png)

- Prediction 2: ![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_pred2.png)

- Prediction 3: ![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_pred3.png)

- Prediction 4: ![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_pred4.png)

- Prediction 5: ![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_pred5.png)


By now taking the average we have:
![Optional Text](../master/Images/tta_avg_pred.png)

And the image is **correctly** classified !
